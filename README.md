# Weighted-and-Unweighted-Graph

I have been tasked to create an algorithm to solve which node has the highest and lowest "influence score" on a weighted and unweighted graph. I used BFS algorithm for the unweighted graph and Dijkstra's algorithm for the weighted graph.

The system also prints the adjancey list of the graphs and finds a specified nodes "Influence score".
